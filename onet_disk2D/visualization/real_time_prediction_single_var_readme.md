## Instructions & Help

1. **Introduction**:
Welcome to my PPDONet (Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network) demo app! This app is designed to provide you with real-time neural network predictions of disk-planet systems using your input disk and planet parameters.

2. **How to Use**:
   - *Step 1*: Move the sliders to adjust the disk and planet parameters.
   - *Step 2*: View the surface density image generated by the neural network.
   - *Step 3 \[Optional\]*: Click the "Source Code" button to navigate to the GitHub repository for this app.

3. **Understanding the Image**:
The predicted image represents the quasi-steady-state surface density distribution of the disk-planet system with the disk-planet parameters on the left. The colorbar on the right shows the surface density normalized by the initial surface density at the planet's radius $(1.0, 0.0)$.

4. **About the Neural Network**:
We use a modified Deep Operator Network (DeepONet, [Lu et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00302-5)) to predict the disk-planet system. The network is trained on more than 400 FARGO3D simulations with randomly generated disk and planet parameters. The trained network takes less than 1s to predict the image on a laptop.

For more detail, please wait for our paper, which is currently under review.
