# PPDONet: Deep Operator Networks for Fast Prediction of Solutions in Disk-Planet Systems

We develop a tool, which we name Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network (PPDONet), that can predict the solution of disk-planet interactions in protoplanetary disks in real-time. We base our tool on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), a class of neural networks capable of learning non-linear operators to represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations.
With PPDONet we map three scalar parameters in a disk-planet system -- the Shakura & Sunyaev viscosity $\alpha$, the disk aspect ratio $h_0$, and the planet-star mass ratio $q$ -- to steady-state solutions of the disk surface density, radial velocity, and azimuthal velocity.  We demonstrate the accuracy of the PPDONet solutions using a comprehensive set of tests. Our tool is able to predict the outcome of disk-planet interaction for one system in less than a second on a laptop, speeding the calculation by many orders of magnitude compared with conventional numerical solvers. A public implementation of PPDONet is available at \url{https://github.com/smao-astro/PPDONet}.

## Web app demo

We have developed a web app demo for PPDONet. Please visit [this link](https://ppdonet-1.herokuapp.com) to try it out!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

[//]: # (See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.)

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.9
```

### Installing

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/smao-astro/PPDONet.git
```

Then, install the required packages:

First create a virtual environment, then activate it, and run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

### Web app demo

```
python real_time_prediction.py \
--sigma_run_dir trained_network/single_log_sigma \
--v_r_run_dir trained_network/single_v_r \
--v_theta_run_dir trained_network/single_v_theta \
--nxy 256
```
And open the link you get from the terminal in your browser.

### Predicting the solutions of a batch of disk-planet systems

```
python -m onet_disk2D.predict \
--run_dir trained_network/single_log_sigma \
--parameter_file parameter_examples.csv \
--save_dir trained_network/single_log_sigma/predictions \
--num_cell_radial 200 \
--num_cell_azimuthal 600 \
--name pred
```
Please have a look at the `parameter_examples.csv` file for the format of the input parameter file. Add more rows of parameters as you wish. Be aware that the predictions are warranted only for the parameter ranges that the network is trained on.
